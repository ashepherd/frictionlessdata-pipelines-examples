# Join two data files together

In this version I wanted to see if pipelines could:

1. handle a tab-separated formatted file
2. join two data files together to createt 1 new CSV file

### Pre-processing I did:

1. I took the v1/niskin-bottle-samples.csv and converted it to a TSV file (tab-separated) called dataset_3773.tsv
